# **Rewards Management API for Balance√®**

The Rewards Management API is a Spring Boot application designed to manage customer reward balances and cashback transaction history. This API provides endpoints for retrieving a customer's current cashback balance and viewing their cashback transaction history. The application integrates security, allowing for secure access to resources through JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.

**Project Structure**
_Packages_
Config
MapperConfig: Configures the ModelMapper to handle entity-to-DTO conversions.
Controllers
Contains a single controller that exposes two endpoints:
Get Rewards Balance: Retrieves the total cashback and current balance for a specific customer.
Get Cashback History: Returns the transaction history, including cashback earned.
**Data**
_This package contains:_
1. Entities: Classes representing database tables.
2.  Repositories: Spring JPA repositories that interface with the database.
**DTOs**
Contains Data Transfer Objects used to send data to the frontend instead of raw database entities.
**Exceptions**
Includes an exception used throughout the application for error handling.
**Security**
Contains all security-related configurations and components:
JWTAuthFilter: Intercepts HTTP requests and extracts JWT tokens for authentication.
PasswordConfig: Manages password encoding and decoding.
SecurityConfig: Configures Spring Security 6, including protected routes, filters, and exception handling.
UserAuthenticationEntryPoint: Handles unauthorized access exceptions.
UserAuthenticationProvider: Manages JWT generation and validation.
UsernamePasswordAuthFilter: Extracts username and password for authentication during login.
WebConfig: Configures CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for the API.
Mappers
Uses MapStruct for mapping between entities and DTOs.
**Services**
Contains two services:
Authentication Service: Manages customer authentication, credential verification, and new customer registration.
Rewards Service: Handles retrieving customer reward balances and cashback transaction history.
**Endpoints**
1. Get Rewards Balance
   Endpoint: /api/rewards/balance
   Method: GET
   Request Parameters: customerId (as query parameter or path variable)
   Response: Returns a JSON object containing:
   customerId: The unique identifier of the customer.
   totalCashback: The total amount of cashback earned.
   currentBalance: The available balance for cashout.
2. Get Cashback History
   Endpoint: /api/rewards/history
   Method: GET
   Request Parameters: customerId (as query parameter or path variable)
   Response: Returns a JSON array of transactions, where each transaction includes:
   transactionId
   transactionDate
   amountEarned
   description
   Authentication
   The application uses JWT for stateless authentication. Every request to a protected endpoint must include a JWT in the Authorization header. JWT tokens are generated and returned upon successful login and registration.

Login and Registration endpoints are the only ones that do not require a token to access. After successful login or registration, the API will return a JWT that the client can use for subsequent requests.
Security Configuration
Stateless Application: No session is maintained by Spring. All protected resources must include a valid JWT for access.
JWT Structure: The JWT includes user details and is sent as a Bearer token in the request header.

**How to Run the Project**
**Clone the repository:**

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/love-ara/RewardsManagementApi
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd rewards-management-api
Run the application using Maven:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw spring-boot:run
API Testing:

Use Postman or curl to test the API endpoints. Ensure that you have a valid JWT for accessing protected endpoints.


**Project Setup**
Prerequisites
Java 17
Maven
A database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
Postman (optional for testing)
Database Configuration
Update the application.properties file with your database credentials:

**properties**
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/rewards_db
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
API Testing with JWT
After a successful login or registration, use the returned JWT token for subsequent requests:

bash
Copy code
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/rewards/balance?customerId=1' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>'
